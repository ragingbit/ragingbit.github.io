It&apos;s also pretty open-ended in how you can use it. When collaborating in a team or an open repository, if everyone has their own view of how to use Git, we quickly end up with a fractured and inconsistent history of changes.</p><h2 id="branch-names">Branch names</h2><p>When creating a new branch it&apos;s recommended to use consistent branch naming that includes the type of task and the issue number. This allows for automation to pick up information for linking issues with pull requests, or creating versions for new releases. What that naming convention looks like is often particular to a team or OSS project but would probably look something like <code>feature/vp312-crud-endpoints-for-cars</code>.</p><ul><li><code>feature</code>: The prefix before the first slash is generally reserved for the type of task. It can (and probably should) be chosen from a range of standardised categories: feature, fix or chore. Non-trunkbased development also tends to utilise release/tag and hotfix prefixes.</li><li><code>vp312</code>: The issue number, identifying which issue the branch is tied to. Branches should generally only cover one issue.</li><li><code>crud-endpoints-for-cars</code>: A very brief description for humans. </li></ul><h2 id="commits">Commits</h2><p>Do them often. Failing to commit often can result in headaches and pains trying to walk back changes that have become too large.</p><p>Intent is a key factor in writing brief, informative and relevant commit messages. Consider the intent of the commit, what is it that you&#x2019;re accomplishing? Try to avoid &quot;update&quot; or &quot;thing&quot;, or the technical description of what you&#x2019;re doing if it&#x2019;s a feature commit and instead focus on the feature itself: instead of &#x201C;add create-endpoint to car controller&#x201D; a much more descriptive message would be &#x201C;allow cars to be updated via api&#x201D;. This might seem superfluous when squash-merging pull requests but it allows for traceability and clarity in reviewing before the code is merged.</p><p>Try to follow an established standard, or modify one to suit. <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">Conventional Commits</a> is a style that&#x2019;s easy to learn and form a habit around, with permissive conventions around types, categories and issue-linking. Conventional commits also help create a good summary for pull request change lists. They can be used to good advantage in the merge-commit message for pull requests, helping to categorise and link to issues and releases, as well as automating release notes.</p><h3 id="conventional-commit-examples">Conventional commit examples</h3><pre><code>chore: update postcss for es6</code></pre><ul><li><code>chore</code>: commit type</li><li><code>update postcss for es6</code>: commit description</li></ul><pre><code>feat(cars)!: remove ability to update cars via api</code></pre><ul><li><code>feat</code>: commit type</li><li><code>(cars)</code>: optional scope</li><li><code>!</code>: optional signifier for breaking change</li><li><code>remove ability to update cars via api</code>: commit description</li></ul><pre><code>feat(cars-reports): allow more properties when filtering cars

If you maintain a branch over a longer period of time, integrating the newest changes from the target branch often helps resolve conflicts quickly, making the final pull request merge easier to prepare.</p><p>Rebasing the branch onto the target is preferable to merging the target into the branch, to maintain a clean history and change tree, also helping to reduce the friction of any merge conflicts down the line and the ability to trace changes.</p><p>Configuring the default behaviour of pulls to use rebasing rather than merging is one way to ensure you don&#x2019;t forget: <code>git config --global pull.rebase true</code></p><p>More here: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase</a></p><h2 id="maintaining-a-clean-local-history">Maintaining a clean (local) history</h2><p>Something that frequently helps when tracing earlier changes in a local feature branch is having a clean and readable commit history that follows a reasonably structured timeline. One way to achieve this is to manually amend earlier commits with interactive rebasing. Bryan Braun writes about <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/02/23/editing-a-commit-in-an-interactive-rebase/" rel="noreferrer">editing a commit in an interactive rebase</a>. Another option is to use git fixup and autosquash which allows you to create fixup-commits for earlier (un-pushed) commits and then using <code>git --autosquash</code> to automatically prune your git history, which Andrew Lock writes about in his article about <a href="https://andrewlock.net/smoother-rebases-with-auto-squashing-git-commits/" rel="noreferrer">auto-squashing commits</a>.</p><h2 id="links">Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/02/23/editing-a-commit-in-an-interactive-rebase/">https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/02/23/editing-a-commit-in-an-interactive-rebase/</a></li><li><a href="https://andrewlock.net/smoother-rebases-with-auto-squashing-git-commits/">https://andrewlock.net/smoother-rebases-with-auto-squashing-git-commits/</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Red, Green, Refactor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Using Red-Green-Refactor is a way to ensure that the code we write is the result of the capabilities we ask of it.]]></description><link>https://ragingbit.github.io/red-green-refactor/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">653240035feaa848657966e9</guid><category><![CDATA[quality]]></category><category><![CDATA[refactoring]]></category><category><![CDATA[tdd]]></category><category><![CDATA[testing]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Johannes Steen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 10:19:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://ragingbit.github.io/content/images/2023/10/tempImagetsfn3q.gif" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://ragingbit.github.io/content/images/2023/10/tempImagetsfn3q.gif" alt="Red, Green, Refactor"><p>There are numerous ways to maintain quality and correctness in the code we write - behaviour driven development, test driven development, fear driven development.
